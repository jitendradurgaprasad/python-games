## 🎰 Slot Machine Game
A simple and fun text-based slot machine game in Python.

### How it works:
- You start with a balance of **100 credits**.
- On each spin, the amount you bet will be **deducted from your balance**.
- You’ll see **3 random symbols** every spin.
- If all three symbols match, you **win a prize** and your balance increases 🎉.
- If your balance reaches 0, the program ends.

### Notes
- Beginner-friendly code
- Easy to play and modify
- I’ll keep adding more games to this repository in the future 🚀
